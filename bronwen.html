			<p>I decided to create a level for Squad after noticing a distinct decline in challenging terrains featured in the Project Reality successor title. Squad, as a spiritual continuation to the legendary mod, I feel needs more maps that reward coordinated, planned, and thoughtful use of its combined arms gameplay.</p>

	    	<p>There are currently some maps in Squad that replicate the sort of thing im describing here, but they appear to be underplayed and neutered compared to their BF2 engine counterparts. For instance, although maps such as Lashkar Valley are present, it seems to lack truly impassable terrain features as well as complimentary tunnel systems and mountian passes that made it so distinct among its peers. In project reality, victory on Lashkar as Blufor meant one was able to successfuly win against not only the enemy, but the terrain itself which pulled infantry down from favorable features into gullys and ravines and pushed vehicles into dangerous choke points to be ambushed.</p>

	    	<p>It is precisely this dynamic, which made PR maps so interesting to play, that made me want to create Bronwen which attempts to maintain this tradition in map design. Set in the melted permafrost of the near-future arctic, Brownwen presents a dangerously open landscape devoid of major hills and defalade. Slightly elevated treelines and vegetation rich lakes serve as the only  consistent cover and concealment for infantry. In addition, these key features include vast trench networks with elaborate bunker configurations for players to dig into.</p>

	    	<p>Consequently, I expect infantry firefights to regularly exceed 300 meters, making coordination with light armor and armored personel carriers essential for success. Moreover, coordination with mortars and other fire support assets will be necessary to create necessary supression to take key terrain. Overall, I hope to create an environment that discourages the fast-paced meta currently existing in squad which encourages wave-style overwhelming attacks on enemy FOBS and objectives which will necessarily reward decisive, more planned assaults and maneuvers.</p>

	    	<p> The map is still very much a work in progress and only time will tell if my objectives for the map are achieved by its design, but nevertheless I hold Bronwen as an instructive and educational opportunity to explore some more advanced concepts in level design.</p>
